This is the finance tracker app from the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer course

I Used twelvedata.com and got real pricing information for stocks, forex, and crypto instead of using what every that other service is.  I wouldn't accept mey API keys.  I tried and I tried and it just didn't like me.  12Data is awesome.
